NOTES ON VERIFICATION OF SHAPE FUNCTIONS
----------------------------------------

1. The option of static condensation does not work with the L2-projection

2. Verification with condition
 
       error/norm  <  1.d-12

   fails for some H(curl) functions with p=6. 
   It passes the test though with 1.d-11. This means that we are loosing up to 4 digits.

3. Frontal solver fails for p=5, it asks for a bigger temporary memory? I have switched
   to MUMPS.

4. To test orientations, I have written routine 
         
       problems/MPI_TESTS/GALERKIN/change_orientations

   that has to be called from input_DEFAULT (I have placed it in the right place
   and tested `by hand', then commented out).

   This routine has to be fed with input parameters somehow from the script. The range
   of parameters should correspond to geometry file `tet_hexa_prism_pyram'

   Idec = 1  No = 1,...,22   Nor = 0,1
   Idec = 2  No = 1,...8     Nor = 0,...,5
   Idec = 3  No = 1,...,8    Nor = 0,...,7

   After changing an orientation, one should call the projection routines, looping through
   polynomial orders IP=1,...,MAXP. This will be a total of

                22*2 + 8*6  + 8*8  =  156

   calls. Depending upon a platform, the verification can easily take a night.
