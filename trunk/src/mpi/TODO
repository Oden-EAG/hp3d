Mesh distribution:
1. done, take care of contraints in distributing mesh
   (need father nodes if constraint node)
2. done, allocate solution dofs before receiving them
3. done, send/receive calls for dof data
4. done, packing and unpacking dof data
5. distribute geometry dofs, update_gdof
6. done, uniform mesh refinement node generation (global_href):
   - set subdomain sons of mdle nodes, according to father node
   - allocate dofs only within subdomain, using visit flags
   - 'activate' nodes as before, but allocate solutions DOFs only if needed
7. not necessary, avoid re-sending/re-receiving edge,face,and vertex dofs
8. use OpenMP for loops in par_mesh, whenever possible
9. not necessary, use non-blocking communication when useful
   (not useful when unpacking is done right after receive)
10. done, update_Ddof
11. done, printing and debugging routines (par_aux)
12. done, use 64 bit integers
13. job script option in application
14. done, Solver interface (MUMPS)
15. use MPI_Wtime/omp_get_wtime instead of other timers
16. done, load balancing with Zoltan
17. timer for data migration and load balancing
18. data migration with zoltan
