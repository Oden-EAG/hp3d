TODO

1. done, take care of contraints in distributing mesh
   (need father nodes if constraint node)
2. done, allocate solution dofs before receiving them
3. done, send/receive calls for dof data
4. done, packing and unpacking dof data
5. done, uniform mesh refinement node generation (global_href):
   - set subdomain sons of mdle nodes, according to father node
   - allocate dofs only within subdomain, using visit flags
   - 'activate' nodes as before, but allocate solutions DOFs only if needed
6. done, update_Ddof
7. done, printing and debugging routines (par_aux)
8. done, use 64 bit integers
9. done, job script option in application
10. done, Solver interface (MUMPS)
11. done, load balancing with Zoltan
12. done, timer for data migration and load balancing
13. done, parallelize initialization routine
14. done, use MPI_Wtime instead of other timers
15. done, distribute geometry dofs, update_gdof
16. done, node stores too much info; delete unused data (error matrix, etc.)
17. done, OpenMP parallelize refresh routine
18. done, OpenMP parallelize close_mesh routine
19. done, OpenMP parallelize global_pref routine
20. done, distribute assembly get_info routine
21. done, graph partitioning with zoltan (parmetis)
22. done, write custom partitioner for fiber
23. done, implement nested dissection MUMPS solver
24. done, OpenMP parallelization update_Ddof
25. done, check loops over NRELES/NRNODS, and parallelize with OpenMP
26. done, remove node ref filter
27. done, extend 'find_neig' routine to work in irregular mesh
28. done, remove PYHP3D references
29. done, remove pointers from NODES data structure; instead use a pointer to 
          another type structure that holds the pointers to the dof data.
          if this pointer is not associated, then no dof data is held on that node;
          if this pointer is associated, then some dof data is held on that node
30. done, make node data type as lean as possible (now 64byte)
--------------
31. OpenMP parallelize 'enforce_min_rule, enforce_max_rule'
32. Integrate LASER code into par_hp3d
33. OpenMP parallelize global_href routine
34. Implement paraview/vtk visualization library (parallel I/O)
35. Eliminate all "syscom.blk" dependencies
36. data migration with zoltan
37. remove hard limit on MAXNODES (instead, do realloc with a WARNING, and show time for realloc)
38. remove old shape functions package (SHAPE=0 option)
39. implement LB weights for elements
40. revisit OpenMP parallelization update_gdof
41. make corrections to find_neig routine
42. make corrections to global_pref routine (dof copying)

F --> F90:
- done, data_structure3D.F, and then parallelize loops (e.g., reset_visit)
- all other relevant files
- delete back/ folders and F_OLD files

- get rid of Zoltan warning about 'failing to dealloc memory' when 'RETURN_LISTS' is 'EXPORT'
