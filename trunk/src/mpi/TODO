TODO

Mesh distribution:
1. done, take care of contraints in distributing mesh
   (need father nodes if constraint node)
2. done, allocate solution dofs before receiving them
3. done, send/receive calls for dof data
4. done, packing and unpacking dof data
5. done, uniform mesh refinement node generation (global_href):
   - set subdomain sons of mdle nodes, according to father node
   - allocate dofs only within subdomain, using visit flags
   - 'activate' nodes as before, but allocate solutions DOFs only if needed
6. done, update_Ddof
7. done, printing and debugging routines (par_aux)
8. done, use 64 bit integers
9. done, job script option in application
10. done, Solver interface (MUMPS)
11. done, load balancing with Zoltan
12. done, timer for data migration and load balancing
13. done, parallelize initialization routine
14. done, use MPI_Wtime instead of other timers
15. distribute geometry dofs, update_gdof
--------------
16. data migration with zoltan
17. node stores too much info; delete unused data (what about error matrix?)
18. not necessary, use non-blocking communication when useful
   (not useful when unpacking is done right after receive)
19. not necessary, avoid re-sending/re-receiving edge,face,and vertex dofs
20. use OpenMP for loops in par_mesh, whenever possible
21. implement LB weights for elements

F --> F90:
- data_structure3D.F

- do not pass coordinate vector x to nodgen (used for debugging with vertices)
- delete unnecessary data from the nodes data type
- get rid of Zoltan warning about 'failing to dealloc memory' when 'RETURN_LISTS' is 'EXPORT'
