F. Fuentes, Nov 14 : New shape functions are located in src/element/shape_1
=============================================================================
The shape functions here (src/element/back) are now obsolete and not used
anymore.

They are kept for historical reasons.

The functions are not even compiled. To compile them rename the file
listObsolete.mk back to list.mk and recompile the whole library.

NOTE: There are still some issues that have not been addressed with some of
      the shape functions here, so if you are going to use them, be aware
      that you will be using them at your own risk.

=============================================================================
P. Gatto, Sep 14 : construction of shape functions is not robust with respect
                   to orientations defined in module element_data!
=============================================================================

1) Array "ivert", defined multiple times (!) throughout the package, should
   be replaced by array "IJKV" defined in module "element_data".

2) Array "norient221", again defined multiple times (!) throughout the package,
   plays a similar role to array "NFAXES" defined in "element_data".
   More specifically:

     norient221(1,:) = NFAXES(3,:)
     norient221(2,:) = NFAXES(1,:)
     norient221(3,:) = NFAXES(2,:)

   "NFAXES" should be used in place of "norient221", and the code should be
   reconciled.

3) In the construction of blending functions for the brick, arrays

     IXIEDGE  ,  IBLENDE  ,  NBLENDE
     IXIFACE  ,  IBLENDF  ,  NBLENDF

   should be used. Look at old routine "shapeHb".

4) Subroutine "local2global" should be used to rotate coordinates to
   account for orientation. No need for duplication!
