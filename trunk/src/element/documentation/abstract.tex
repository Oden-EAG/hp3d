A unified construction of high order shape functions is given for all four classical energy spaces ($H^1$, $H(\mathrm{curl})$, $H(\mathrm{div})$ and $L^2$) and for elements of ``all'' shapes (segment, quadrilateral, triangle, hexahedron, tetrahedron, triangular prism and pyramid). 
The discrete spaces spanned by the shape functions satisfy the commuting exact sequence property for each element.
The shape functions are conforming, hierarchical and compatible with other neighboring elements across shared boundaries so they may be used in hybrid meshes.
Expressions for the shape functions are given in coordinate free format in terms of the relevant affine coordinates of each element shape. 
The polynomial order is allowed to differ for each separate topological entity (vertex, edge, face or interior) in the mesh, so the shape functions can be used to implement local $p$ adaptive finite element methods.
Each topological entity may have its own orientation, and the shape functions can have that orientation embedded by a simple permutation of arguments.
%Each topological entity (vertex, edge, face or interior) has associated a set of shape functions, a polynomial order and (potentially) an orientation.
%Hence, the shape functions can be used to implement local $p$ adaptive finite element methods.
%If desired, shape functions can be orientation embedded simply by permuting some entries in their expressions.
