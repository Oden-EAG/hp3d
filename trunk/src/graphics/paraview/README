Paraview Graphics
=================

Linking to VTK
--------------

1. add VTK in your .bashrc file:

module load vtk
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/org/groups/aeg/kyungjoo/lib/HDF5/1.8.9/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


2. add VIS_LIB to your m_option file:

VIS_PATH        =  /org/groups/aeg/kyungjoo/lib/UHM/2.3.1/
VIS_LIB         =  -L$(VIS_PATH)/lib -lvis \
                   -L/org/groups/aeg/kyungjoo/lib/HDF5/1.8.9/lib -lhdf5 -lhdf5_hl \
                   -L$(VTK_LIB) -lvtkhdf5 -lvtkhdf5_hl -lvtklibxml2 -lvtkzlib


3. Since visualization libraries have been compiled with "gfortran", you need to compile the code with "gfortran" as well.


Using Paraview Graphics from HP3D
---------------------------------

Create a "vtk" folder inside your project folder. The driver routine is "paraview_driver".
Each time it is invoked, it increments the POSTFIX (a visitation flag) by 1, and creates files:

PREFIX_POSTFIX.xmf : main file

PREFIX_geom.h5 : geometry file

PREFIX_ ... _POSTFIX.h5 : files containing real (and imaginary) part of solutions for all attributes, components and loads.

Invoke Paraview, and open the .xmf file. In case of multiple .xmf files (with incremental
postfixes), Paraview groups them together and allows the user to open all of them at the same
time (which you should do.) The POSTFIX can be understood as a time-step. For example, routine
"vis_shape_funct", dumps all H1, H(curl), H(div), L2 shape functions to Paraview. The incremental
postfixes allow us to step through all the shape functions, one a time.

The PREFIX is just a string. It is usefull to distinguish b/w different test cases.
