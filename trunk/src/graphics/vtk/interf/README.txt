The new VTK graphics runs as a separate application which displays files
generated by hp3d. Within hp3d, all code is written in Fortran. There
are two driver routines:

plotgeomVTK: writes the file VTK/geom for visualizing geometry
plotsolnVTK: writes the file VTK/soln for visualizing the solution

Both routines call routines in VTK_interf.F which handle the file IO (at
present, the IO is formatted because I couldn't get unformatted IO to
work). There are also routines for evaluating the components of the
solution (eval_vtk) and for selecting the quantity to be displayed
(disp_vtk).
