=========================================================================
  Downloading and installing the HP3D finite element library

=========================================================================


1. Dowloading the library from the repository
---------------------------------------------

Run the following commands :

  mkdir HP3D (or anything else)

  cd HP3D

  svn co https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/hp3d/LIBRARY/trunk/ . (the dot is important!)


2. Linking to external libraries, setting compiler options, etc.
----------------------------------------------------------------

In folder HP3D/m_options_files, create your own file by hacking an existing one.

Run the following commands :

  cd HP3D

  ln -s  m_options_files/m_options_mine  m_options


3. Compiling the library
------------------------

Compilation is governed by preprocessing flags COMPLEX, PARALLEL, and SHAPE.

  COMPLEX  = 0  -->  real    version : stiffness matrix, load vector(s) and
                                       solution dofs are real-valued

  COMPLEX  = 1  -->  complex version : stiffness matrix, load vector(s) and
                                       solution dofs are complex-valued

  PARALLEL = 0  -->  sequential version of MUMPS

  PARALLEL = 1  -->  parallel   version of MUMPS

  SHAPE    = 0  -->  shape functions of Gatto, Demkowicz, Kim, 2008
                     (H1,H(curl) for selected element shapes only)

  SHAPE    = 1  -->  shape functions of Fuentes et al., 2014
                     (all spaces, all shapes)

Run the following command :

  make lib COMPLEX=0,1 PARALLEL=0,1 SHAPE=0,1

Library will be created under either HP3D/complex or HP3D/real.


4. Existing projects
--------------------

A few projects have been successfully implemented.

AIR FORCE :
  svn co https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/hp3d/projects/ongoing/AF

NSF :
  mkdir BIOEM
  cd BIOEM
  svn co https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/hp3d/projects/ongoing/BIOEM/trunk/ . (dot is important!)
